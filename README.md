## About the Video Course
If you are searching for an AJAX development app and everything you need to bring AJAX into your web applications, this course is for you.

AJAX can load data from external files into JavaScript, seamlessly and without page reloads. jQuery makes working with AJAX easy, providing powerful methods for AJAX calls. AJAX is an essential skill for modern web development.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a serverâ€”and all in the background. AJAX allows for web pages to change content dynamically, load content from external files, load JSON data, and use the data within JavaScript.

JavaScript is used to bring technologies together to create amazing user experiences, with JSON data and web elements. jQuery is ideal for making AJAX calls as it simplifies code and makes it easier.
